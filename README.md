## Reporting
* Report for input and tasks being issued via CobaltStrike
  * Contains INPUT (operator input) and TASK (cna + response from input)
* Report for downloaded and uploaded files
  * Contains download.log, INDICATOR (hash and filename) and entries containing the following keyphrases:
    * Uploading beaconloader:
    * Uploading payload file:
    * Tasked beacon to upload
  * Not really pretty right now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Report of the valid beacons. They have the following set:
  * Beacon.hostname
  * Beacon.joined


## Remarks
* Only beacons with input or tasks are being listed to allow the report to focus on actual actions instead of an complete picture. As a result, beacons which will just be spawned due to persistence and not be used will be ignored.
* <s>Beacons which have not been used (no metadata), thus listed under the unknown folder will be ignored</s>
* Beacons without associated IDs, usually happens from broken .cna scripts will be ignored
